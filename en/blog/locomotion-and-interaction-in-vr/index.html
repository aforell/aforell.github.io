<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This project was part of the &ldquo;Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality&rdquo; class, I took in the winter semester 2023/24 at TU Darmstadt. The goal of the project was to design, implement and evaluate a locomotion and interaction technique for virtual reality. It was highly encouraged to be creative and to have the same metaphor for locomotion and interaction.</p>
<p>For the locomotion technique we were simply tasked with coming up with a way for the user to get around a 3D space. For the interaction part, the user should be able to select objects in 3D and change their position and rotation.</p>
<p>To aid us in our implementation, we were given a unity project which contained a 3D environment with a parkour and an example locomotion and interaction technique. The parkour consists of a road that winds in different ways, and which has different altitudes. Additionally, there are multiple coins for the user to collect. This is to test the capabilities of our future locomotion technique. For testing our interaction technique, there are three checkpoints along the road, where the user has to position and orient a t-shaped object in a specific way.</p>
<p>The unity project of the parkour is available <a href="https://github.com/wenjietseng/VR-locomotion-parkour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
.</p>

<h2 id="preview-of-the-finished-project">Preview of the finished project</h2>
<p>Before I go into detail about the development process of this project you can look at the GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/aforell/locomotion-and-interaction-in-vr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
  and see a demo video of me doing the parkour with my implemented locomotion and interaction technique here.</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hL_C9sl6sIk" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>(Unfortunately at the time of the recording, there was still a bug that prevented the third checkpoint from triggering, which means the last lap doesn&rsquo;t have any coins in it.)</p>
<h1 id="the-idea">The Idea</h1>
<p>While brainstorming, my ideas quickly revolved around some sort of rope pulling mechanic. Some examples were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing rod: You would throw your hook and instead of reeling in the hook, you would pull yourself towards it.</li>
<li>Lasso: You would swing and throw a lasso and pull yourself along the thrown rope.</li>
<li>Bow: You would shoot an arrow attached to a rope. Then you would pull yourself along the rope.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end I landed on the idea of throwing a grappling hook and then pulling yourself towards it. As I wanted to combine the locomotion and interaction in one metaphor, I had to modify the idea. For the interaction part you would be able to throw the hook at objects and then pull the objects towards yourself.</p>
<p><img src="/hook-rope-idea.jpg" alt="Hook with rope"></p>
<p>This was the basic idea of what I wanted to implement, but when thinking about the limitations of the idea, it became obvious that with this interaction technique, it would be tedious to position and orient an object in a specific way.</p>
<p>For example, if you just want to manipulate the position of an object, you would have to throw your hook at it, which is rather imprecise. There is no way for small adjustments. If you miss, you have to throw the hook again. Then you can also only move the object along the rope, so if you want to move the object perpendicular to the rope, you would have to first position yourself in the right spot and then pull the object.</p>
<h2 id="the-modified-idea">The modified idea</h2>
<p><img src="/pole-vault.jpg" alt="Pole Vault"></p>
<p>The modified idea was inspired by pole vaulting, a sport where athletes jump over a high bar, using a long pole to help lift themselves up. With this idea you could still throw a hook with a rope attached and pull yourself towards it or pull objects towards yourself. But now you could also turn your rope rigid and therefore make a stick out of it.</p>
<p>For locomotion you would then be able to push the stick into the ground and by that, lift yourself up. For interaction you would be able to lift distant objects that are attached to the stick and spin it around to rotate the objects.</p>
<p>With this rigid pole you would be able to make small adjustments after throwing the rope, manipulate objects at a distance and introduce verticality to the locomotion and interaction.</p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>I started by implementing the basics. I tried using the oculus integration to manage my virtual reality session in Unity, as this was given in the project template. This felt rather restrictive to me, so I switched to using Unity’s XR Core framework.</p>
<p>After setting up an XR Origin I imported a grappling hook model from <a href="https://skfb.ly/6DvAF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketchfab</a>
 and started setting up basic grab mechanics. For this, I had to create an XR Interaction Manager in the scene and give each of the player hand objects a sphere trigger collider and an XR Direct Interactor script. I also gave the grappling hook 2 box colliders to estimate it’s shape, a rigid body and an XR Grab Interactable script. There I set “Throw on detach” to true and “Throw velocity scale” to 5. With this I could already grab the hook and throw it away.</p>
<p>The next part was rendering a rope from the player to the hook. For this I created a rope object with a Rope.cs script. This script has a reference to an attachment point object as a child of the player and an attachment point as a child of the hook. I then use a Line Renderer component to draw a line between these two points. This needs to be done every frame as both attachment points move over time and the rope should reflect that.</p>
<p><img src="/GrappleHookThrowing.gif" alt="Throwing the hook with a rope attached"></p>
<p>While trying to add collisions to my rope I run into my first big problem. Because the rope changes every frame, its collider should also change every frame. I generate the new mesh for the rope collider by using the LineRenderer.BakeMesh() function. The problem now occurs when I try to grab the rope. For grabbing I need the OnTriggerEnter() and OnTriggerExit() hooks to detect whether  a hand is in contact with the rope or not. Assume in one frame the OnTriggerEnter() event fires because the hand collides with the rope. What happens in the next frame? The OnTrigger() event fires again. Why? Since each frame the rope is getting a new mesh, this counts as a new collision as the hand detected a collision with a new mesh. This also means that OnTriggerExit() never gets called, because the mesh of the old collision doesn’t exist anymore. So how can I detect if a hand is currently touching the rope?</p>
<p>My solution: Implement a timer that ticks up every frame and tracks the time since the last trigger enter. Only at a trigger enter event does the timer reset back to zero. I can now test if my timer is bigger than a threshold. If it is bigger, that means the hand is not colliding with the rope, if it is smaller, that means the hand is colliding with the rope.</p>
<p>When grabbing the rope, it should also look like the rope is attached to the hand that grabbed the rope. For this each frame I add the attached hand position to the line renderer between the player attachment point and the hook attachment point. This is easy enough if you grab the rope with only one hand. When you grab it with two hands, you must determine and remember which hand is in front of the other hand to set the correct sequence of points inside the line renderer.</p>
<h3 id="different-modes">Different modes</h3>
<p>To implement my idea, I had to differentiate between different modes of controlling the hook. On the one hand I want to move myself in a non-rigid mode where the rope is flexible, and I pull myself along it. I also want a rigid mode where the rope is rigid, and I can move myself by pushing the stick into the ground. On the other hand, I want a non-rigid mode where I can pull objects towards myself and a rigid mode where the objects are attached to a stick, like roasting marshmallows over a fire.</p>
<p>To implement these four different control modes I have two state variables: isRigidMode switches the control methods of the hook from non-rigid to rigid and isObjectMode switches between locomotion and interaction.</p>
<p>The player can switch the rigid mode by pressing the left trigger on the controller. To visualize this behavior change, the rope changes its color from brown to grey when activating rigid mode. They can also switch the object mode by pressing the right trigger on the controller. This is visualized by having red orbs around the hook in object mode and no orbs in player mode.</p>
<h2 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h2>
<h3 id="non-rigid-locomotion">Non-rigid locomotion</h3>
<p>For the locomotion in non-rigid mode, I calculate the movement of a hand that is attached to the rope by subtracting the current hand position from the position of the last frame and projecting the resulting vector on the direction of the rope.</p>
<p><img src="/non-rigid-hand-movement-code.jpg" alt="Non-rigid hand movement code"></p>
<p>This movement vector is then applied to the player’s character controller component. I also multiply a pull speed to the movement vector because otherwise the player could only move as fast as they could swing their arms.</p>
<p><img src="/non_rigid_locomotion.gif" alt="Non-rigid locomotion"></p>
<h3 id="rigid-locomotion">Rigid locomotion</h3>
<p>For rigid locomotion, I want to calculate the position I would get if I went the current length of the rope from the hook in the direction of the vector between my hands. I then want to move the player to that goal direction. This creates the illusion of pushing the stick into the ground and lifting yourself up through it.</p>
<p><img src="/rigid-movement-code.jpg" alt="Rigid movement code"></p>
<p>I don’t instantly move the player to the goal position but only move them with slightly dampened movement speed to smooth over the movement. Otherwise, it feels like teleporting when you move your hands quickly.</p>
<p><img src="/rigid_locomotion.gif" alt="Rigid locomotion"></p>
<h2 id="interaction">Interaction</h2>
<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>
<p>I used the following assets in my project:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://skfb.ly/6DvAF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grappling hook model</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/click/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Options button sound</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
<p>For the evaluation I was tasked to conduct a (very) small user study with 2 people and myself. Although the group size was small, the study gave valuable feedback for my project. At the start of the study, I gave each participant an introduction to VR by showing them the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/deeplink/?action=view&amp;path=/app/1863547050392688&amp;ref=oculus_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta First Steps in VR App</a>
. I thought this would increase their familiarity with VR in general, as both participants have rarely played with VR before. After this, I gave the participants a few minutes to play around with my locomotion and interaction technique, before having them complete the parkour.</p>
<p>The participants were tasked to complete the parkour as fast as possible, to collect as many coins as possible and to be as accurate as possible in the interaction part. I then noted comments they had during play and interviewed them afterwards.</p>
<p>The questions from the interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;On a scale from 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now?&rdquo; (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>&ldquo;On a scale from 1 to 10 how present did you feel in the virtual world?&rdquo; (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>&ldquo;On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the locomotion task?&rdquo; (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>&ldquo;On a scale from 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the interaction task?&rdquo; (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
<li>&ldquo;On a scale from 1 to 10, how intuitive were the controls?&rdquo; (1 lowest 10 highest)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the interview some other data was also collected during play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average time per round (average over all three participants)</li>
<li>Average accuracy per round (average over all three participants)</li>
<li>Average amount of finished rounds (average over all three participants)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>
<p><img src="/eval-stats.jpg" alt="Evaluation Results"></p>
<p>First, you can clearly see the difference in the performance for me (Developer) and the other participants. Naturally, I got a better combined time and accuracy than the others, since I had so much more experience with the game from developing it. Secondly, you can see the average time overall for the parkour is 15.16 minutes and the average accuracy (collected coins) is only 57%. One Participant got frustrated by the interaction task and then just went for the fastest completion time without going for the coins at all. The other participant went for the coins but then took too long to finish the parkour.</p>
<p>During the play test, it became clear that the task was not that intuitive. Handling 4 different control modes was just too much to learn at once. It was also obvious that the locomotion was much more enjoyable than the interaction parts. This is also backed by the interviews. It took the participants a long time to learn the controls but once they figured them out, they had fun with the locomotion technique. The interaction technique was still not well received. Most of the time, players would just pull the objects towards themselves and then rotate the object in hand.</p>
<p>The implementation of the vignette was valuable, as it helped both participants with their motion sickness. One participant rated his motion sickness 7 and after using the vignette for a while it reduced to 4.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was hard to know which exact mode the player was in, so the visibility of the modes could be improved. Also, sometimes the hook would get lost so one participant wished for a button to teleport the hook back to the player.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>A button to teleport the hook back to the player would ruin the immersion in my opinion but might decrease some frustrations players had with the task.</p>
<p>Increasing the visibility of the different modes is definitely something I would like to implement. For this I will change the color of the controllers based on the active mode and attach some red spheres to one controller (like on the hook) when object mode is active.</p>
<p>A better tutorial will probably decrease the frustrations players had with learning the mechanics. I tested this on another player that wasn’t part of the user study. I introduced the different modes to him only after he mastered the previous mode. The result was that he had more fun and much more control over what he was doing than the other two players of the user study.</p>
<h1 id="my-takeaways">My Takeaways</h1>
<ol>
<li>I can now prototype ideas for VR applications in Unity.</li>
<li>I now understand some of the difficulties when designing locomotion and interaction techniques for a VR application.</li>
<li>I know the importance of early testing. In the future I will give my applications to test users more often and earlier in the development process.</li>
<li>I know the importance of good time management.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Left trigger</b> to switch between rigid / non rigid mode</li>
<li><b>Right trigger</b>  to switch between object grabbing mode and player movement mode</li>
<li>Push down on a <b>joystick</b> to open the options menu</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Basic Movement</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Grab the rope or the hook with the grab button</li>
<li>Do a pull motion while holding on to the rope to move</li>
<li>In rigid mode there is a difference when you grab with one hand or when you grab with two hands</li>
<li>grabbing with two hands will let you move the stick around you</li>
<li>grabbing with one hand will let move along the axis of the stick</li>
<li>have fun :)</li>
</ul>
