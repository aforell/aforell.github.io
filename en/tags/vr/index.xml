      <description>Introduction This project was part of the &amp;ldquo;Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality&amp;rdquo; class, I took in the winter semester 2023/24 at TU Darmstadt. The goal of the project was to design, implement and evaluate a locomotion and interaction technique for virtual reality. It was highly encouraged to be creative and to have the same metaphor for locomotion and interaction.
For the locomotion technique we were simply tasked with coming up with a way for the user to get around a 3D space.</description>
